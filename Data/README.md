In order for the input food data to be tractable, a new categorization of foods was provided based on the first two digits of each item's USDA food code. This new categorization greatly reduced the dimension of the problem. The same data bank was used to set up nutrient constraints by selecting a representative food for each category (for example branded milk for category 11) and recording the per serving nutrients of that representative.
